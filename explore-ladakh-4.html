the confluence of the rivers Shayok and Indus in the Kargil region west
of Leh live a people known as Drok-pa. They are racially and culturally
distinct from the rest of Ladakhis. Their religious practices more so
resemble the animist practices of the pre-Buddhist religion Bon than
that of Buddhism as practiced in the rest of Ladakh. One curious
cultural feature is their abhorrence of the cow or any of its products.
Their ancient traditions and way of life are partly preserved through
their songs and hymns. One of these is a description of an ibex hunt
and the ibex is specially sacred to them. Another recalls their
migration from the Gilgit region further west in Pakistan, an event
which must have occurred well before Gilgit came under the influence of
Islam. Their language is said to be akin to that spoken in Gilgit and
by immigrants from Gilgit settled in Dras south of Kargil. Their facial
features, however, as well as their head and dress ornaments are the
most striking and first noticeable as one encounters them. Whereas
Ladakh&#8217;s population seems to be mostly of Tibetan origin, they are of
pure Indo-Aryan stock, believed perhaps to have descended from the army
of Alexander of Macedonia. Today they number around two thousand
inhabitants settled in five villages. <br />

to changing season. Their flocks, their yaks, and goat's hair furnish
the raw material of which they make their ropes, their clothes and
shoes. All day long men and women are busy milking, churning the milk
into butter, making ropes, weaving mats and other fabrics and repairing
their tent. These people have been completely beyond the pale of all
