the Kashmir Valley and over the Ancient&nbsp; Zoji La pass nestles a
land, &#8216;Ladakh&#8217;, the Land of High Passes. It is a magical land, so
completely different from the green landscape of most other parts of
the inhabitat Himalayas. Ladakh is nature at its extreme. A land of
freezing winds and blazing sunlight, Ladakh is a cold desert lying in
the rain shadow of the Great Himalayas and other smaller ranges. Little
rain and snow reaches this dry area, where the natural forces have
created a fantastic landscape. Ladakh forms a part of the state of
Jammu and Kashmir in India. This region is made up of two
administrative districts namely Leh District, with its headquarters at
Leh, and the Kargil District, with its headquarters at Kargil, and
covers a total area of about 59,000 square kilometers.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Ladakh
is at an average elevation of 2,700 m to 4,200 m above sea level. The
aridity of this region is due to its location in the rain shadow area
of the Great Himalayas, elevation and radiation of heat from the bare
soil. The region is extremely dry, with an annual rainfall as low as
10cubic centimeter. Greenery is a sign of villages.</p>
              <p><strong class="welcome-body-text">Few Places of interest in Ladakh</strong><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                <span class="sub-title">Nubra Valley</span><br />
                <span class="body-text">The
Nubra Valley means Ldumra (the valley of flowers), situated in the
north of Leh. The average altitude of the valley is about 10,000 ft.
above the sea level. The main attractions in this area are Bactarian
Camels (Shaggy double humped Camel) around the sand dunes, Deskit and
Samstanling monasteries and Khardung la Pass (18,380 ft.) above sea
level. This Tour can be organized for 3 days/2 nights. </span><br />

                <strong class="body-text">Getting There</strong><br />
                <span class="body-text">The
road journey to Nubra valley leads through Khardongla (the highest
motor able road in the world) 18380 ft. around 40 kms away from Leh. On
crossing the pass, you come across Khardong village, Khalsar and Deskit
(the main villages of Nubra valley). Deskit village, Hundar village,

lake is 40 miles in length and nearly 2-4 miles in width at a height of
4267m above the sea level What strikes on seeing this lake is the
lovely color of its water, especially towards evening, which is of the
richest deep blue, over the whole expanse, at morning time, it is of a
lighter a very brilliant color. The water of the Lake is not that salty
as sea water. <br /> Pangong Tso trip can be organized in two days and

is the headquarter of Ladakh District, and the largest town of the
region. It is located to the north of the Indus River at an elevation
of 3600m above the sea level. The town is marked by the nine-storied
Namgyal Palace and Namgyal Tsemo (victory peak), built by Tashi Namgyal
on his victorious in reunification of the Upper and Lower Ladakh. Leh
became the capital of Stod (upper Ladakh) during the reign of king
Graspa Bum- Lde, who ruled Ladakh from 1400 to 1430 AD. In the later
period, Leh became an important center for trade in Central Asia. Leh
remained merely a headquarter of Ladakh district until 1974, when
Ladakh was opened for foreign tourists. Since then Leh became the
centre, for tourism related activities in the region. </p>
              <p><span class="welcome-body-text"><strong>How to Reach</strong></span></p>
              <p><span class="sub-title">Overland Approach</span><br />
                    <strong>Srinagar to Leh </strong>-
The overland approach to Ladakh from Kashmir Valley via Kargil is
approx. 434 Km, which remains open for traffic from early June to
November. The most dramatic part of this road journey is the ascent up
the 11,500 feet / 3,505 m high Zoji-La, the pass in the Great Himalayan
Wall that serves as the gateway to Ladakh. The J &amp; K State Road
Transport Corporation (J&amp;K SRTC) operates regular Deluxe and
Ordinary bus services between Srinagar and Leh on this route with an
overnight halt at Kargil. Taxis are also available at Srinagar for the
journey. Groups can charter Deluxe and A-class buses for Leh, Kargil or
Padum (Zangskar) from the J &amp; K SRTC at Srinagar. </p>
              <p class="body-text"><strong>Manali to Leh -</strong>
Since 1989, the 473 km. Manali-Leh road has been serving as the second
overland approach to Ladakh. Open for traffic from around mid-June to
early October. This high road traverses the upland desert plateau of
Rupsho, altitude ranges from 3,660m to 4,570m. A number of high passes
are crossed before reaching Leh, among which the highest one known as
TaklangLa is the world's second highest motorable pass at an altitude
of 17,469 ft/5,235m. Shared taxis are also available both from Leh and
Manali. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drive from
Manali&nbsp; leads you to the most historical pass of Himachal Pradesh,
the Rohtang Pass(3980 m). The landscape surprisingly changes into the
rugged brown of the rain shadow area of Lahaul. The landscape changes
into naked desert after crossing a few villages of Lahul with prayer
flags on their roofs.Your journey finishes at Leh making it a drive of
lifetime&#8217;s experience.</p>
