It is a magical land, so completely different from the  green landscape of most other parts of the inhabitat Himalayas.  Ladakh is nature at its extreme. A land of freezing winds and blazing sunlight,  Ladakh is a cold desert lying in the rain shadow of the Great Himalayas and  other smaller ranges. Little rain and snow reaches this dry area, where the  natural forces have created a fantastic landscape. Ladakh forms a part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India. This  region is made up of two administrative districts namely Leh District, with its  headquarters at Leh, and the Kargil District, with its headquarters at Kargil,  and covers a total area of about 59,000 square kilometers.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Ladakh is at an average elevation of 2,700 m  to 4,200 m above sea level. The aridity of this region is due to its location  in the rain shadow area of the Great Himalayas, elevation and radiation of heat  from the bare soil. The region is extremely dry, with an annual rainfall as low  as 10cubic centimeter. Greenery is a sign of villages.</p>
              <p><strong class="welcome-body-text">Few Places of interest in Ladakh</strong><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                <span class="sub-title">Nubra Valley</span><br />
                <span class="body-text">The Nubra Valley  means Ldumra (the valley of flowers), situated in the north of Leh. The average  altitude of the valley is about 10,000 ft. above the sea level. The main  attractions in this area are Bactarian Camels (Shaggy double humped Camel)  around the sand dunes, Deskit and Samstanling monasteries and Khardung la Pass  (18,380 ft.) above sea level. This Tour can be organized for 3 days/2 nights. </span><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                <strong class="body-text">Getting There</strong><br />
                <span class="body-text">The road journey to Nubra valley  leads through Khardongla (the highest motor able road in the world) 18380 ft.  around 40 kms away from Leh. On crossing the pass, you come across Khardong  village, Khalsar and Deskit (the main villages of Nubra valley).

The Camel safari can be organized from  Deskit to Hunder village for 2 hours. Hunder village has small monastery and it  is located on the ancient Silk    Route. </span></p>
              <p><strong class="sub-title">Chang Thang</strong> <span class="body-text">- <em>The  land of Nomads</em><br />
                Changthang means Eastern Flat  land, is located in the east of Leh on the Chinese border. The average altitude  of the area is around 14600m above sea level.

                    <span class="body-text">The Tsomoriri Lake  is a beautiful mountain bounded expanse of water, around 240 Kms from Leh in Rupsho Valley.  The Lake is located at 14,000 ft. near a small  village named Korzok. The Nomadic people are most outstanding feature of this Lake area, which grazed herd of goats and yaks. The  Tsokar (the salt Lake) around 76 kms. from  Tsomoriri is also a beautiful and totally different from the Tsomoriri Lake. <br />

              <p><span class="sub-title"><strong>Pangong Lake</strong></span> <br />
                    <span class="body-text">Pangong lake is 40 miles in  length and nearly 2-4 miles in width at a height of 4267m above the sea level  What strikes on seeing this lake is the lovely color of its water, especially  towards evening, which is of the richest deep blue, over the whole expanse, at  morning time, it is of a lighter a very brilliant color.

                            </span>Leh is the headquarter of  Ladakh District, and the largest town of the region. It is located to the north  of the Indus River at an elevation of 3600m above the  sea level. The town is marked by the nine-storied Namgyal Palace and Namgyal  Tsemo (victory peak), built by Tashi Namgyal on his victorious in reunification  of the Upper and Lower Ladakh. Leh became the capital of Stod (upper Ladakh)  during the reign of king Graspa Bum- Lde, who ruled Ladakh from 1400 to 1430  AD. In the later period, Leh became an important center for trade in Central Asia. Leh remained merely a headquarter of Ladakh  district until 1974, when Ladakh was opened for foreign tourists. Since then  Leh became the centre, for tourism related activities in the region. </p>
